#Contributing

I welcome enhancements and bug fixes.  Here are some guidelines:

 * Clearly describe and demonstrate what's being addressed with example code.

 * Keep it simple - add one feature / fix one bug per pull request / issue.

In general, I aim to review and respond to everything in a few business days. 

##Thank you!
