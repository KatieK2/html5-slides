#Contributing

I welcome input - particularly enhancement requests and bug fixes.  

 * Please let me know what you find missing, love or hate about this slideshow framework.

 * Pull requests / bug fixes: Clearly describe and demonstrate what's being addressed with example code.

 * Keep it simple - add one feature / fix one bug per pull request / issue.

In general, I aim to review and respond to everything in a few business days. 

##Thank you!
