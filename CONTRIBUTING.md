#Contributing

I love pull requests!

 * If you just want to get started, have a look at the open enhancements and bugs in issues.

 * Pull requests / bug fixes: Clearly describe and demonstrate what's being addressed with example code.

 * Keep it simple - add one feature / fix one bug per pull request / issue.

In general, I aim to review and respond to everything in a few business days. 

##Thank you!
